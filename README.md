# 🤖 Bootcamp Chatbot - Capstone Project

**🎓 Educational Demonstration | Bootcamp Capstone Project**

A multi-agent AI chatbot system showcasing modern web development, AI integration, and system architecture concepts.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This capstone project demonstrates:
- **System Architecture & Design**: Multi-agent AI system with clean separation of concerns
- **Modern Development Practices**: FastAPI, async programming, Docker, CI/CD
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL schema with async operations
- **AI/ML Integration Architecture**: Framework for multiple LLM providers
- **Professional Code Organization**: Modular, documented, industry-standard structure

> **Note**: This project focuses on **architectural demonstration** and **system design skills**. Core AI functionality is implemented as a foundation ready for feature development.

## 🏗️ Architectural Excellence

### What This Project Demonstrates:
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns with agent-based design
✅ **Modern Python**: Async/await patterns, type hints, Pydantic models
✅ **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with auto-generated documentation  
✅ **Database Design**: Proper schema with relationships and indexing
✅ **DevOps Ready**: Docker, environment configuration, CI/CD pipeline
✅ **Scalability Planning**: Modular agents ready for horizontal scaling

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**Before using in production:**
1. Implement proper authentication and authorization
2. Add rate limiting and input validation
3. Configure CORS for specific domains
4. Set up proper logging and monitoring
5. Use HTTPS and security headers
6. Regular security audits

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security information.
